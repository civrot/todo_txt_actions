# Standup

Standup is an add-on for [TODO.txt](https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli) that generates a report for daily stand up meetings.  It creates a list of tasks completed 'yesterday', tasks that still need to be completed, 'today', and an impediments list of tasks tagged with the @impediment context.
